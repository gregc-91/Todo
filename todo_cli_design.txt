
Introduction

Todo aims to be an extension to the usual text based todo list. Enabling viewing, organising, sorting and editing of text based todo files through a command line interface.

It should be
- Robust
- Simple
- Clean

Commands

todo <command>
	list 
		[#Project] [@Tag] [[*]] [#] [@]
		lists all the tasks
			in a file
			in a project
			with tag
			with status
		list all the projects
			in a file
			with tag
			with status
		list all the tags
			in a file
			in a project
			with status
	add
		[#Project] [@Tag] "Task"
	remove
		[#Project] [@Tag] <index>
	do 
		[#Project] [@Tag] <index>
		
	undo
		Undoes the last action
	tidy
		Formats the todo.txt file
			- Removes excess lines
			- Fixes indentation and whitespace
			- Checks for syntax errors
			- Moves done and suspended tasks to done.txt
	
//todo: how to do hierarchical adding of notes?

Project Architecture

The project should use a command based architecture.
Command line arguments should be parsed into a command object.
Command objects are executed to perform the desired action.
A history should be kept to facilitate undo of the last N actions.
